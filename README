# GenBank-Flat-File-Parser

I had a hard time finding a flat file parser for GenBank files in
Java.  Biojava3 does it, but fails to model half of the fields...which
is utterly useless.

Here is my attempt at providing one...

GenBankParser parser = GenBankParser.getInstance();
List<GenBankInfo> results = parser.parse(new File("/tmp", "single.gb.gz"));

NOTE: it expects gzipped files as inputs.
