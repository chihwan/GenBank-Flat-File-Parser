# GenBank-Flat-File-Parser

I had a hard time finding a flat file parser for GenBank files in
Java.

Here is my attempt at providing one...

GenBankParser parser = GenBankParser.getInstance();
List<GenBankInfo> results = parser.parse(new File("/tmp", "single.gb.gz"));

NOTE: it expects gzipped files as inputs.
